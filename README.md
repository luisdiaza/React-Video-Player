# **This is an application I built (originally cloned from a boilerplate project provided by an instructor) to help me understand/build React components and structure applications with Redux.**

**Technologies used:** It uses the YouTube API, and Bootstrap.  

## Concepts learned:
- **Note:** React is used to create user interfaces.  

**Transpiling:** Taking source source from one language and transforming it into another or into a lower version of the same language.

**JSX:** A syntax that lets you write JavaScript like HTML. Babel transpiles the expressions into actual JavaScript code.  

**Elements:** Describe what you want to see on the screen.  

**Components**: Small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element that is to be rendered to the page. Can be created using Javascript functions or ES6 classes.
