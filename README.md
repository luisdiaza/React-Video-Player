# **An application used to understand/build React components and structure applications with Redux.**

**Technologies used:** It uses the YouTube API, and Bootstrap.  

- **Note:** To run the application, type npm start in the command line.

## Concepts learned:
- **Note:** React is used to create user interfaces.  

**Transpiling:** Taking source source from one language and transforming it into another or into a lower version of the same language.

**JSX:** A syntax that lets you write JavaScript like HTML. Babel transpiles the expressions into actual JavaScript code.  

**Elements:** Describe what you want to see on the screen.  

**Components**: Small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element that is to be rendered to the page. Can be created using Javascript functions or ES6 classes. We write multiple components and nest them one inside the other to make complex applications in a simple way. Each component represents different aspects of an application. In mine, I have components for the search bar, video video player, video previews, a list containing the video previews, and one for the index.js file that contains all of the above components. Only one component can be made per file.
