This is an application I built to help me understand/build React components and structure applications with Redux. Through this application I am learning the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props", “state", and eventing.

I am also becoming familiar with the toolchain supporting React, including NPM, Webpack, Babel, and ES6/ES2015 Javascript syntax

I plan on using the YouTube API.
