This is an application I built (originally cloned from a boilerplate project provided by an instructor) to help me understand/build React components and structure applications with Redux. Through this application I am learning the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props", “state", and eventing.

It uses the YouTube API, and Bootstrap.
